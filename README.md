Blue Saga
=========

A free indie mmo rpg created by Jonathan Stahl. This is my personal version where I do bug fixes for the classic server. I also experiment with different improvements, mostly in the server. I will soon start my own server with new original content.

Github project
==============
This github project was unlocked by players Natas and Quacky 
when they collected all 20 monster cards in the hidden archipelago.

The code is really messy, since I started this project when new to programming.
I am not proud of the code, but very proud of what it accomplished. 

Anyone can create their own version of Blue Saga (change/improve/add code, change the balancing and content in the database, add graphics) as long as no original graphics, logos, music or credits are changed.

Any version of Blue Saga must use the bs_user.jar for authentication in order
to preserve the Blue Saga community and forums found on the website:
http://www.bluesaga.org

The game must remain free to play.

Have fun!
