### i194 / Curses And Cures
Type: Readable / Book
Description:
  [...] undead curses are the strongest amongst all curses. There is no simple way of removing such a curse since it is often binded to its caster. [...]
  [...] There are three undead lords who rule the dark world beneath the earth. They possess powerful magic and encountering them will result in instant death.
  [...] One of the three is called Nimbul, and is referred to as the undead mage. This one specializes in curses and summoning. Nimbul gains its powers from its summonings.
  [...] By defeating Nimbuls summonings, its powers can be weakened, which is preferred if there should be any chance of defeating the lord itself.
