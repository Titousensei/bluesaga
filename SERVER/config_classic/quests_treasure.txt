    Find the hidden treasure that Fiffilina has hidden in the water cave underneath Outlaw Harbor.
QuestMessage:
    Alright then, let's get serious now..
    The next treasure is hidden on the island that lies just north-west of Outlaw Harbor. It's the island where the ancient gates are.. the ones leading to the Dead Kingdom. Go find it!
RewardMessage:
    Nice, you're really starting to get my attention! So, I'm gonna be honest with you..
    The treasure isn't why I've been talking to you all this time. I've got something much more important for you to deal with. But only when you feel strong enough to change the outcome of the future.
    When you do, come and talk to me.. I'll tell you everything.

QuestMessage:
    Well, I'm gonna be honest with you..
    The treasure hunting has never really caught my interest and, most of all, I wouldn't waste my time pleasing others by arranging treasure hunts..
    I simply used the treasure hunting as a test to measure your capability of finding things you desperately want.
    The thing is that.. I knew from the very moment I saw you.. that you.. were cursed..
    How? Well.. They say that people who are facing a certain obstacle are more likely to identify others in the same situation.
    I think you know what I'm about to say..
    I've.. been.. cursed.. too..
    Listen, we are not given many options here. We need to find the dark powers that are threatening us before they find all of us..
    I bet you saw that locked door in that hidden cave on Island of the Ancient Gates.. And I think you might have a clue on where this door leads..
    It's an entrance to the Dead Woods.. And underneath those dying woods lies the Dead Kingdom.. and that is where I think we can find answers for a cure.
    What I'm gonna ask you for is something a lot more dangerous than any task you've ever been handed. I would've done it myself if I believed I was strong enough.. but I know I'm not.
    I know that Gulhrug has the key to that door and now that I've shown you where it is.. I can do nothing but leave this realms faith in your hands..
    I'm sorry that I was playing these weird little treasure games with you.. I just needed to know that you were the right person to entrust with this dangerous task. Good luck, I'll be praying for your return!
